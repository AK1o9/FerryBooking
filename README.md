# FerryBooking
Being one of my first relatively big projects, this software application is used for registering customers, booking ferry seats and printing reservation tickets for each seat.
Includes both business and economy class seats. Programmed entirely in Python 3.7. 

## Features
- **Purchasing Module:** Reserve or purchase seating tickets in either business class or economy class boats or ferries and then select a departure time.
- **Printing Module:** Print the ticket after the user purchases it and enters their information.
- **Seat Arrangement (*or Viewing*) Module:** View seating arrangements (shows seats that are reserved and those that are available) and allow users to change their seats either within the same boat or another.
